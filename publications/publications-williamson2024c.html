<p class="text-justify">Fish are one of the most abundant animals on the planet, and are of vital importance to both aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems, human communities, and industry. Wild fish are threatened by climate change, pollutants from industry and agriculture, disease from invasive and farmed species, and overfishing. Monitoring wild fish populations is essential in planning marine policy and sustainable management of marine environments. </p>

<p class="text-justify">Early fish life stages are especially sensitive to environmental impacts, with their health and development severely disrupted by challenges that might not affect a mature fish. Monitoring the youngest fish gives insight into how the adult population might look in several years.  Current monitoring methods are expensive and labour-intensive, and collect data sparsely in time and space. This leads to infrequent and underpowered studies, potentially missing trends in the evolution of fish populations.</p>

<p class="text-justify">This thesis helps to address these problems by introducing a novel, automated imaging system for laboratory studies of early fish life stages. Alongside the imaging system, an analysis suite was developed that uses machine learning and machine vision to automatically extract biologically relevant data from the collected images. These measurements can be used to monitor the development of fish eggs and larvae in response to pollutants or other stressors. The automated system is able to collect far more information, far more quickly, than traditional methods, and with minimal human intervention. Unlike most existing laboratory imaging methods, which are fatal to the animals imaged, the system is non-invasive, allowing fish to be measured repeatedly over the course of development. This allows new insights not possible with traditional methods.</p>

<p class="text-justify">This work demonstrates the new system in use in the laboratory, and validates the system against existing sampling techniques. The system is also demonstrated in the field on board research vessels, and trial efforts are described in using an autonomous underwater vehicle and other in situ imaging platforms with the goal of extending such automated studies to the ocean.The automated imaging system is able to obtain many more measurements in a fraction of the time of existing methods, and obtains results comparable to manual microscopy.</p>
